GCGraph -- Graph Generator of GC inforamtion from GC::Profiler

-- Description

   GCGraph generate graph of GC inforamtion from GC::Profiler. You can see the 
   generated graph via Firefox. URL is "http://localhost:8088/graph".
   You can use other browser have "<canvas>" tag. But I don't test.

   Graph is updated per 1 second. GCGraph uses technology like COMMET and 
   AJAX. But it is very poor, because GCGraph supposes only 1 client.

   GCGraph need Ruby 1.9.0 and later including GC::Profiler module. 

-- Install

  Copy lib/gcgraph.rb to directory in ruby libray path.
   

-- Usage

  ruby -r gcgraph program.rb args ...

-- Bugs

  Many. I wish to fix the bug breaking console output by log 
  of WEBBrick instantly.
